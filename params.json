Ugh. Who hasn't? More times than not, the browser is running in forced compatibility mode. While you *could* walk them through the steps to help troubleshoot the issue, you can confirm it easily by downloading and connecting to a simple script.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nDownload and add the following script to your site: `detect.js`\r\n\r\nThen, simply point to it:\r\n\r\n`<script src=\"js/ie-mode/detect.js\"></script>`\r\n\r\nTo test the page, fire up IE and run the IE Developer Toolbar (F12) to switch modes. If you don't know how to toggle between modes, check out [Testing sites with Browser Mode vs. Doc Mode](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/10/19/testing-sites-with-browser-mode-vs-doc-mode.aspx)\r\n\r\nTo see an example of what the client will see, check out `example.html`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
